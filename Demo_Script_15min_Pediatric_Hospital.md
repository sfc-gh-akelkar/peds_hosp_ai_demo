- Real-time air quality index: 78 (Moderate)
- Historical correlation: AQI >100 = 23% increase in asthma ED visits
- Environmental justice analysis: Higher impact in zip codes with lower income
- Predictive alert: "High ozone forecast for tomorrow - prepare for increased asthma visits"

**Population Health Impact**:
- "Proactive patient outreach during poor air quality days"
- "Community advocacy for environmental health improvements"
