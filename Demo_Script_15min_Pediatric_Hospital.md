## **‚è±Ô∏è Minutes 0-2: Opening & Value Proposition**

### **Opening Hook:**
"Good morning! Today I'm going to show you something that's transforming how healthcare organizations interact with their data. Imagine if your clinical teams could ask questions about patient outcomes in plain English and get instant answers. Imagine if your researchers could find relevant studies and protocols in seconds, not hours. That's Snowflake Intelligence - enterprise AI that knows your business."

### **Why Healthcare? Why Now?**
"Healthcare is perfect for showcasing enterprise AI because:
- **Complex data relationships** - patients, providers, departments, outcomes
- **Critical decisions** - patient safety depends on fast, accurate insights  
- **Regulatory requirements** - HIPAA compliance and audit trails are non-negotiable
- **Multiple stakeholders** - clinicians, researchers, administrators all need different views"

### **What You'll See Today:**
"I'll demonstrate three core capabilities:
1. **Cortex Analyst** - Natural language to SQL for instant insights
2. **Cortex Search** - Intelligent document discovery across clinical content
3. **Snowflake Intelligence Agent** - AI orchestration across multiple data sources"

## **‚è±Ô∏è Minutes 2-6: Cortex Analyst - Natural Language Analytics**

### **Business Scenario:**
"Let's put you in the shoes of Dr. Sarah Chen, Director of Clinical Research. It's Monday morning, the board wants to know about patient outcomes, and she needs answers now - not next week."

### **The Traditional Problem:**
"Normally, Dr. Chen would submit a request to IT, wait 3-5 days for a custom report, then schedule another meeting to discuss findings. By then, the moment has passed."

### **Snowflake Intelligence Solution:**
*[Navigate to Snowsight ‚Üí CLINICAL_ANALYTICS_VIEW ‚Üí Query with Analyst]*

"Watch what happens when Dr. Chen asks her questions directly..."

#### **Live Demo - Query 1:**
**Type:** *"What is the average length of stay for pediatric ICU patients?"*

**Highlight:**
- "Notice how it instantly generates perfect SQL"
- "It understands 'pediatric ICU' means our PICU department"
- "No SQL knowledge required - just business questions"

#### **Live Demo - Query 2:**
**Type:** *"Show me readmission rates by department for July through September 2024"*

**Highlight:**
- "It knows 'readmission rates' means calculating percentages of return visits"
- "Automatically filters to the specified time period"
- "Joins multiple tables behind the scenes"

#### **Live Demo - Query 3:**
**Type:** *"Which diagnoses have the highest total treatment costs?"*

**Highlight:**
- "Complex financial analysis made simple"
- "Correlates clinical data with cost data automatically"
- "This would normally require a data analyst and hours of work"

### **The Business Impact:**
"Dr. Chen now has her answers in 30 seconds, not 3 days. She can make informed decisions in real-time, respond to board questions immediately, and spend more time on patient care instead of waiting for reports."

## **‚è±Ô∏è Minutes 6-10: Cortex Search - Document Intelligence**

### **Business Scenario:**
"Now Dr. Chen needs to find clinical protocols for a new research study. She's looking for asthma treatment guidelines and HIPAA compliance requirements for pediatric research."

### **The Traditional Problem:**
"Clinical teams waste hours searching through document repositories, policy manuals, and research databases. Finding the right protocol can take days of manual searching."

### **Snowflake Intelligence Solution:**
*[Navigate to Snowsight worksheet]*

"Instead of keyword searching, watch semantic AI in action..."

#### **Live Demo - Clinical Protocol Search:**
```sql
SELECT document_id, title, category 
FROM TABLE(SEARCH_CLINICAL_DOCS(
    'pediatric asthma emergency treatment protocols', 
    {'limit': 3}
));
```

**Highlight:**
- "Semantic search understands intent, not just keywords"
- "It found our pediatric asthma care protocol instantly"
- "Notice it understands 'emergency treatment' context"

#### **Live Demo - Compliance Search:**
```sql
SELECT document_id, title, category
FROM TABLE(SEARCH_OPERATIONS_DOCS(
    'HIPAA compliance requirements for pediatric research',
    {'limit': 3}  
));
```

**Highlight:**
- "Found our HIPAA compliance policy specific to research"
- "Cross-references pediatric-specific requirements"
- "This usually takes researchers hours to locate"

#### **Live Demo - Research Literature:**
```sql
SELECT document_id, title, category
FROM TABLE(SEARCH_RESEARCH_DOCS(
    'population health chronic disease management outcomes',
    {'limit': 3}
));
```

**Highlight:**
- "Discovers relevant research studies from our repository"
- "Understands the connection between population health and chronic disease"
- "Enables evidence-based research decisions"

### **The Business Impact:**
"What used to take hours of manual document searching now happens in seconds. Clinical teams can access the right protocols instantly, ensuring better patient care and regulatory compliance."

## **‚è±Ô∏è Minutes 10-14: Snowflake Intelligence Agent - AI Orchestration**

### **Business Scenario:**
"Now for the really powerful part. Dr. Chen needs to prepare a comprehensive research proposal that combines patient data analysis, clinical protocols, and external medical literature."

### **The Traditional Problem:**
"This requires multiple systems - EMR for patient data, document repositories for protocols, PubMed for research, regulatory databases for compliance. Correlating all this information manually takes weeks."

### **Snowflake Intelligence Solution:**
*[Navigate to Snowflake Intelligence Agent]*

"One AI agent that orchestrates everything..."

#### **Agent Demo - Multi-Modal Research Query:**
*[Show agent interface and configuration]*

**Type:** *"Analyze asthma patient outcomes in our population health program and find relevant treatment protocols and current research guidelines"*

**Highlight:**
- "Single query combines structured data analysis with document search"
- "AI agent automatically uses the right tools for each part of the question"
- "Provides comprehensive, contextualized responses"

#### **Agent Demo - Regulatory Intelligence:**
**Type:** *"What are our quality metrics for pediatric care and do we have policies that address improvement opportunities?"*

**Highlight:**
- "Correlates operational data with policy documents"
- "Identifies gaps between performance and policy"
- "Provides actionable insights for improvement"

#### **Agent Demo - External Integration:**
**Type:** *"Find current CDC guidelines for pediatric asthma care and compare with our protocols"*

**Highlight:**
- "Integrates external data sources with internal protocols"
- "Keeps clinical teams current with latest guidelines"
- "Ensures evidence-based care delivery"

### **The Business Impact:**
"Research that used to take weeks of coordination across multiple systems now happens in one intelligent conversation. Dr. Chen can focus on medical research instead of data gathering."
