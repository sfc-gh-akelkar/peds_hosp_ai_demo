# Population Health Research Study
**Pediatric Asthma Outcomes in Urban Communities**

**Principal Investigator**: Dr. Sarah Johnson, MD, MPH  
**Co-Investigators**: Dr. Michael Chen, MD, Dr. Lisa Rodriguez, PhD  
**Study ID**: LCH-2025-001  
**IRB Approval**: #2024-089  
**Funding**: NIH Grant R01-HL987654

## Study Overview

### Background and Significance

Asthma affects approximately 6.2 million children in the United States, with higher prevalence rates in urban, low-income communities. Children from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds experience disproportionately higher rates of asthma-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and mortality. Understanding the complex interplay of environmental, social, and clinical factors affecting pediatric asthma outcomes is crucial for developing targeted interventions.

Lurie Children's Hospital serves a diverse urban population with significant disparities in asthma outcomes. Our hospital data shows:
- 25% higher ED visit rates for asthma in zip codes with <100% federal poverty level
- 40% increased readmission rates among non-English speaking families
- Seasonal variations correlating with air quality indices and housing conditions

### Study Objectives

**Primary Objective**: To identify clinical, environmental, and social determinants of pediatric asthma exacerbations leading to emergency department visits and hospitalizations in urban children.

**Secondary Objectives**:
1. Develop a predictive model for asthma exacerbations using clinical and environmental data
2. Assess the impact of social determinants of health on treatment adherence and outcomes
3. Evaluate the effectiveness of community-based interventions on asthma control
4. Identify genetic biomarkers associated with severe asthma phenotypes in diverse populations

### Snowflake Data Architecture

**Data Sources Integration**:
```sql
-- Clinical data from Epic EHR
CREATE TABLE clinical_encounters AS
SELECT 
    patient_mrn,
    encounter_date,
    diagnosis_codes,
    procedure_codes,
    medications_prescribed,
    vital_signs,
    lab_results
FROM epic_data_warehouse
WHERE diagnosis_codes LIKE 'J45%'

-- Environmental data from external APIs
CREATE TABLE environmental_measures AS
SELECT 
    measurement_date,
    zip_code,
    air_quality_index,
    pm25_level,
    ozone_level,
    pollen_count,
    weather_conditions
FROM environmental_data_feeds

-- Social determinants from screening tools
CREATE TABLE social_determinants AS
SELECT 
    patient_mrn,
    screening_date,
    household_income_category,
    insurance_type,
    food_security_score,
    transportation_access,
    housing_quality_index
FROM patient_screening_data
```

**Data De-identification Process**:
- Patient names replaced with study IDs using consistent tokenization
- Dates shifted by random offset (-90 to +90 days) while preserving temporal relationships
- Geocoding generalized to census tract level
- Direct identifiers removed or generalized per HIPAA Safe Harbor method

**Research Database Structure**:
```sql
-- Main cohort table
CREATE TABLE study_cohort AS
SELECT 
    study_id,
    age_at_enrollment,
    gender,
    race_ethnicity,
    primary_language,
    insurance_type,
    zip_code_census_tract,
    asthma_severity_category,
    comorbid_conditions
FROM patient_dim p
JOIN study_enrollment e ON p.patient_key = e.patient_key

-- Outcomes table
CREATE TABLE asthma_outcomes AS
SELECT 
    study_id,
    outcome_date,
    outcome_type, -- ED visit, hospitalization, urgent care
    severity_score,
    length_of_stay,
    treatment_received,
    discharge_disposition
FROM patient_encounter_fact
WHERE diagnosis_primary LIKE 'J45%'
```

## Statistical Analysis Plan

### Descriptive Analysis
- Patient characteristics summarized by demographic and clinical variables
- Asthma exacerbation rates calculated per patient-year of follow-up
- Geographic mapping of asthma outcomes by census tract
- Seasonal patterns analysis using time series methods

### Predictive Modeling
```sql
-- Feature engineering for ML model
CREATE TABLE model_features AS
SELECT 
    c.study_id,
    c.age_at_enrollment,
    c.gender,
    c.race_ethnicity,
    COUNT(e.encounter_key) as prior_ed_visits,
    AVG(cm.fev1_percent_predicted) as avg_lung_function,
    MAX(env.air_quality_index) as max_aqi_exposure,
    sd.food_security_score,
    sd.housing_quality_index
FROM study_cohort c
LEFT JOIN patient_encounter_fact e ON c.study_id = e.study_id
LEFT JOIN clinical_measures_fact cm ON c.study_id = cm.study_id
LEFT JOIN environmental_measures env ON c.zip_code = env.zip_code
LEFT JOIN social_determinants sd ON c.study_id = sd.study_id
GROUP BY c.study_id, [other grouping columns]
```

**Machine Learning Approach**:
- Random Forest model for exacerbation prediction
- Logistic regression for interpretable risk factors
- Gradient boosting for time-to-event analysis
- Cross-validation with temporal splitting to prevent data leakage

### Subgroup Analyses
- Stratified analyses by age groups (2-5, 6-11, 12-17 years)
- Race/ethnicity-specific analyses to identify disparities
- Socioeconomic status stratification (Medicaid vs. private insurance)
- Seasonal variation analyses by environmental exposure levels
