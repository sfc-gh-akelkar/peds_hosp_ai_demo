**Document Version**: 2.1  
**Effective Date**: January 1, 2025  
**Review Date**: December 31, 2025  
**Department**: Pulmonology, Emergency Medicine, General Pediatrics

## Purpose

This protocol establishes evidence-based guidelines for the assessment, treatment, and management of pediatric asthma patients at pediatric hospitals to ensure consistent, high-quality care and improved patient outcomes.

## Scope

This protocol applies to all healthcare providers caring for pediatric patients (ages 0-18 years) with asthma in:
- Emergency Department
- Inpatient units
- Outpatient clinics
- Urgent care centers

## Clinical Assessment

### Initial Evaluation

**Vital Signs Assessment:**
- Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation
- Temperature (to rule out infection)
- Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) for children ≥5 years

**Physical Examination:**
- General appearance and level of distress
- Work of breathing (use of accessory muscles, retractions)
- Auscultation for wheezing, decreased air entry
- Skin color and perfusion

**Severity Classification:**

**Mild Exacerbation:**
- PEFR >80% of personal best
- Mild dyspnea, speaks in sentences
- Heart rate normal or slightly elevated
- No use of accessory muscles

**Moderate Exacerbation:**
- PEFR 60-80% of personal best
- Moderate dyspnea, speaks in phrases
- Heart rate elevated (age-appropriate ranges)
- Mild use of accessory muscles

**Severe Exacerbation:**
- PEFR <60% of personal best
- Severe dyspnea, speaks only single words
- Heart rate significantly elevated
- Marked use of accessory muscles
- Oxygen saturation <92%

**Life-Threatening:**
- PEFR <33% of personal best or unable to perform
- Cannot speak, extremely distressed
- Cyanosis, poor perfusion
- Oxygen saturation <90%
- Altered mental status

## Treatment Protocols

### Emergency Department Management

**Initial Treatment (All Severities):**
1. Oxygen therapy if SpO2 <92%
2. Albuterol nebulizer 2.5-5mg (weight-based dosing)
3. Ipratropium bromide 0.25-0.5mg with first 3 albuterol treatments

**Mild Exacerbation:**
- Albuterol nebulizer every 20 minutes x 3 doses
- Reassess after each treatment
- Consider discharge after 1 hour if improved

**Moderate Exacerbation:**
- Continuous albuterol nebulizer
- Oral prednisolone 1-2mg/kg (max 60mg)
- Reassess every 30 minutes

**Severe/Life-Threatening:**
- Continuous albuterol nebulizer
- IV methylprednisolone 1-2mg/kg every 6 hours
- Consider IV magnesium sulfate 25-50mg/kg (max 2g)
- Consider ICU consultation

### Inpatient Management

**Admission Criteria:**
- Inadequate response to emergency treatment
- Severe exacerbation requiring frequent treatments
- History of ICU admission or intubation
- Poor social support or medication compliance

**Daily Assessment:**
- Monitor PEFR twice daily (if age appropriate)
- Assess symptom control and medication response
- Review inhaler technique with patient/family
- Monitor for adverse effects of medications

**Discharge Criteria:**
- PEFR >70% of personal best or baseline
- Minimal symptoms with albuterol every 4 hours
- Adequate oral intake and activity level
- Proper inhaler technique demonstrated
- Follow-up appointment scheduled

## Medication Guidelines

### Bronchodilators

**Albuterol (Short-Acting Beta2-Agonist):**
- Nebulizer: 2.5mg for children <20kg, 5mg for children ≥20kg
- MDI: 4-8 puffs every 20 minutes x 3, then every 1-4 hours as needed
- Continuous nebulizer: 10-15mg/hour

**Ipratropium Bromide:**
- Add to first 3 albuterol treatments
- Nebulizer: 0.25mg for children <20kg, 0.5mg for children ≥20kg

### Anti-Inflammatory Medications

**Systemic Corticosteroids:**
- Oral prednisolone: 1-2mg/kg daily (max 60mg) for 3-5 days
- IV methylprednisolone: 1-2mg/kg every 6 hours for severe cases
- Consider longer course for patients with delayed recovery

**Inhaled Corticosteroids:**
- Continue or initiate controller therapy for persistent asthma
- Budesonide, fluticasone, or beclomethasone as appropriate

### Adjunct Therapies

**Magnesium Sulfate:**
- Reserved for severe, refractory cases
- IV dose: 25-50mg/kg (max 2g) over 20 minutes
- Monitor for hypotension and respiratory depression

## Quality Indicators

### Clinical Metrics
- Time to first bronchodilator treatment: <30 minutes
- Appropriate corticosteroid use: >90% for moderate/severe cases
- Length of stay: <24 hours for standard admissions
- Readmission rate: <5% within 30 days

### Patient Safety
- Inhaler technique assessment: 100% of patients
- Asthma action plan provided: 100% at discharge
- Follow-up appointment scheduled: 100% within 1-2 weeks

### Patient Satisfaction
- Provider communication scores: >90th percentile
- Care coordination scores: >85th percentile
- Overall satisfaction: >95%

## Education Requirements

### Patient/Family Education
- Disease pathophysiology and triggers
- Proper inhaler technique (MDI, DPI, nebulizer)
- Peak flow meter use for children ≥5 years
- Written asthma action plan
- Environmental control measures

### Provider Education
- Annual competency training on asthma protocols
- Inhaler technique demonstration skills
- Recognition of deteriorating patients
- Cultural competency in asthma care

## Documentation Requirements

### Required Elements
- Asthma severity classification
- Treatment response assessment
- Medication administration times and doses
- Peak flow measurements (when appropriate)
- Patient/family education provided
- Discharge planning and follow-up arrangements

### Quality Documentation
- Use standardized asthma assessment forms
- Document objective findings (vital signs, PEFR, oxygen saturation)
- Record patient response to treatments
- Note any adverse reactions or complications

## Special Populations

### Infants and Toddlers (<2 years)
- Bronchiolitis vs. asthma differential important
- Albuterol trial with objective assessment
- Consider RSV testing during appropriate season
- Family history and atopic dermatitis assessment

### Adolescents (13-18 years)
- Assess medication adherence and psychosocial factors
- Screen for depression and anxiety
- Address transition to adult care planning
- Consider occupational/exercise-induced triggers

### Complex Medical Conditions
- Patients with congenital heart disease
- Chronic lung disease of prematurity
- Immunocompromised patients
- Consider multidisciplinary team involvement

## Research and Quality Improvement
